For our application we needed to create a model of a AA battery. 
Specifically we wanted a time vs voltage curve so we could plug in
a measured voltage and get out the percent of life on the battery. 
This was the focus of our expirementation. The CC-EL was capable 
of demanding a constant current load, measuring the voltage across 
the battery, and the time the measurement was taken. We used the 
program realterm to capture the serial monitors output into a .txt
file. This data was then displayed in excel and both raw data and 
graphs to be visualised and for cursory evaluation and averaging. 
Later the data was further anylized using mathmatica. From our 
research we were able to determine that above 1.5V a battery is 
considered full and below 0.8V a battery is considered dead. With 
this knowledge in hand we tested duracell batteries at 200mA, 300mA, 
400mA, and 500mA load to see how varying the load affected the 
voltage output of the battery. The voltage output showed a non 
linear increase along the batteries lifespan. This meant that we 
only had time to parameterize the time vs voltage curve for one 
load. We decided to parameterize the battery at as low of a current 
draw as we feasibly could accomplish in order to minimize the tests
effect on the battery. This ended up being 200ma. We were able to 
test four different brands of batteries. Duracel, Energizer, Rayovac, 
and Amazon Basic. Some brands were tested multiple times. In the end 
the time vs voltage curve for all models of battery were averaged 
together. No individual curve varied by more than 2% of the average. 
The greatest source of deviation was the starting voltage of the 
batteries. This averaged time vs voltage curve gave us our model of 
the AA battery that we needed. The data was made into a look up table
to be referenced by our program.
